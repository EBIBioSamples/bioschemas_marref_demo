  "description": "Colwellia sp. MT41. Colwellia sp. MT41 was isolated from a deep sea crustacean; Hirondellea gigas; obtained from the Marianas Trench at a depth of 10;476 meters. This organism is an obligate barophile with optimum growth being seen at 690 bars (6.9 x 107 Pa) at 2oC. No growth was seen at pressures below 380 bars. This organism is one of the most barophilic organisms that has been isolated and will provide information on the adaptations necessary for life under extreme pressure.",
