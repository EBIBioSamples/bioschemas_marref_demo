  "description": "Shewanella sp. W3-18-1. This strain was isolated from Pacific Ocean marine sediments at a depth of 630 m. Shewanella are facultatively anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria, motile by polar flagella, rod-like, and generally associated with aquatic or marine environments. . They are capable of using a variety of compounds as electron acceptors, including oxygen, iron, manganese, uranium, nitrate, nitrite, fumarate, to name but a few. This ability makes Shewanella important for bioremediation of contaminated metals and radioactive wastes. The genus Shewanella comprises 36 recognized and hundreds of uncharacterized cultivable species.",
