  "description": "Flammeovirga sp. MY04 is an agar-liquefying marine bacterium with versatile polysaccharide-degrading abilities. It potently degrades multiple carbohydrates derived from algal, plants, or animals, through the action of the extracellular enzyme systems or surface-associated enzyme complexes. This organism may be useful in bioremediation. The abundant agarase system contains agarases from the families of GH16, GH50, and GH86. The extracellular agarases are stable in a wide range of temperatures, pH values, and NaCl concentrations, and digest agarose into neoagaro-oligosaccharides efficiently. The GH16 modules of surface-associated-agarases contain novel inner peptides that are essential for the enzyme to divide neoagarooctaose into neoagarotetraose.",
